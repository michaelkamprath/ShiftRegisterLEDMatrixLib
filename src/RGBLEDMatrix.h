	 *	@param columns the number of columns in the LED matrix.
	 *	@param bitLayout an RGBLEDBitLayout enum indicating how the RGB bits are arranged 
	 *              in each row.
	 *	@param columnControlBitOn what value a column bit should be set to to the column on.
	 *	@param rowControlBitOn what value a row bit should be set to to turn the row on. 
	 *               E.g. of the row is common anode and a PNP transistor is being use 
	 *               to switch power to the row, the row bit likely needs to be LOW to
	 *               cause the transistor to power the row.
	 *	@param interFrameOffTimeMicros Controls whether an all-off signal is sent to the
	 *				 shift registers in between row updates in order to mitigate LED 
	 *				 ghosting. A value of 0 indicates that no all-off signal should be 
	 *				 sent. A value greater than 0 indicates how many microseconds should
	 *				 be waited until the next row update gets shifted out. Usually a value 
	 *				 less than 3 microseconds is sufficient for most slow row power
	 *				 switching.
	 *  @param slavePin which ard pin is used for the latch signal.
